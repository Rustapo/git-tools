    # If using PHP 7.x, you will need to use the --ignore-platform-reqs option
    composer.phar install

Usage
-----

Current usage. Subject to change until code is finalized and some of these
actions still have @todo.

  # Review bin/conf.php.dist and set values accordingly.
  cp bin/conf.php.dist bin/conf.php
  cd horde-git-tools/bin

  # Options can also be given on command line. See usage for information.
  php horde-git-tools --help

  # Clones all repositories locally to the configured git_base directory.
  php horde-git-tools clone

  # Links (or copies) to a web accessible directory (replacement for old
  # install_dev script).
  php horde-git-tools link

  # List available repositories on remote. Providing the --debug flag will
  # output full response from GitHub.
  php horde-git-tools list

  # Attempt to checkout a specific branch on all repositories.
  php horde-git-tools --branch FRAMEMWORK_5_2 checkout

  # Attempt to git pull --rebase all repositories.
  # Still need to add options like ability to ensure repo is on a specific
  # branch before pulling, option to automatically stash/pop if repository is
  # not clean etc...
  php horde-git-tools pull

  # Report on status of each repository.
  # Still need to tweak and add options, better display etc...

Still todo
----------

- Install vs Linking. Create install action that will perform a full pear
  install, or optionally install specific packages only.
