Horde-Git-Tools
========================================

POC/WIP toolchain for dealing with the upcoming split repository structure of
[Horde](https://github.com/horde/horde),

Installation
------------

Uses composer for dependency management.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mrubinsk/horde-git-tools.git horde-git-tools
cd horde-git-tools
# If using PHP 7.x, you will need to use the --ignore-platform-reqs option
composer.phar install
```
Usage
-----

Current usage. Subject to change until code is finalized and some of these
actions still have @todo.

```sh
# Review bin/conf.php.dist and set values accordingly.
cp bin/conf.php.dist bin/conf.php
cd horde-git-tools/bin

# Options can also be given on command line. See usage for information.
php horde-git-tools --help

# Clones all repositories locally to the configured git_base directory.
php horde-git-tools clone

# Links (or copies) to a web accessible directory (replacement for old
# install_dev script).
php horde-git-tools link

# List available repositories on remote. Providing the --debug flag will
# output full response from GitHub.
php horde-git-tools list

# Attempt to checkout a specific branch on all repositories.
php horde-git-tools --branch FRAMEMWORK_5_2 checkout

# Attempt to git pull --rebase all repositories.
# Still need to add options like ability to ensure repo is on a specific
# branch before pulling, option to automatically stash/pop if repository is
# not clean etc...
php horde-git-tools pull

# Report on status of each repository.
# Still need to tweak and add options, better display etc...
php horde-git-tools status
```

Still todo
----------

-  Create install action that will perform a full pear install of the webmail or
   groupware bundle (or optionally a specified list of applications).

- Subset of Component functionality. I.e., releases, changes, package.xml
  maintenance etc...

- Add action to run an arbitrary git command in all repositories.

- Replace "git pull --rebase" with the "git get" alias from https://www.horde.org/development/git#updating-repository in the pull action?
